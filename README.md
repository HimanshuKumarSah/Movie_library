# Movie Library
This is my first project in React.js.
It uses the omdb api to fetch details of movies (name, year, poster, type) and displays them based on the search query.

To use the project, 
1. Clone the github repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/HimanshuKumarSah/Movie_library.git`
3. cd to the folder
4. Run the project, type in terminal
   `npm start` <br>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
